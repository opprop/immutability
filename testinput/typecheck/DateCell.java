        // q(this-cellSetHours) <: q(this-cellSetHours) |> q(this-getDate) Which is q(this-cellSetHours) <: q(this-cellSetHours)

        // Truly, viewpoint adaptation to receiver doesn't impose additional constraint on receiver. But this makes sense. Because poly
        // means that it can be substited by any qualifiers including poly itself. That's exactly the purpose of method with poly "this" -
        // invocable on all possible types. ReIm also suffers this "not-useful" contraint problem on return type adaptation:
        // q(md) |> q(ret-getDate) <: q(md) which becomes q(md) <: q(md). So there is no reason for ReIm to argue against this "seems-like"

    // adaptating to whatever doesn't make a difference. Only when they are @PolyImmutable, there is real difference between the two.
    // The most tricky case - receiver, return type are @PolyImmutable is proven to be valid in receiver adaptation methodology.
    // ReIm doesn't support instatiating poly and readonly objects, so if return type is poly, method receiver is also poly. ReIm's
    // reasoning using the cellSetHourse, cellGetHours, getDate methods failed to show the necessity of viewpoint adapting to lhs.
